## CONCLUSION :
The project we have implemented “NOODLE”, is an
Infotainment website which provides many functionalities to
the end user. We have also kept non-functional requirements
in mind while developing the project. For instance we have
tried to make it more secure and reliable to the user. We have
used Node.js instead of php because Node.js tends to perform
better while consistently sending requests to the server. Its
asynchronous architecture allows non-blocking execution which
is great for any project that needs speed.
